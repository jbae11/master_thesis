\glspl{NFCS} are system-level analysis tools
that allow tracking of material flow in a \gls{NFC}. Its
functionalities include, but are not limited to, isotopic decay,
depletion calculations, and separating of material streams.
The goal of a \gls{NFCS} is to calculate `metrics' - quantitative
measures of performance that can be compared among fuel cycle
options \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}.

\section{Capabilities required for modeling transition scenarios}
There are specific capabilities required for modeling transition
scenarios. A study by Brown et al. \cite{brown_identification_2016}
identified nine common functionalities for \glspl{NFCS} for modeling
transition scenarios - material compositions, deployment of fuel
cycle facilities, front-end facility models, separations and material
recycle facilities, reactor facilities, back-end features, starting
the new fuel cycle, materials queuing and prioritization under
capacity limitations, and energy demand algorithms. Brown et al.
categorizes each functionality into three tiers - basic, integral,
and exemplary. The functionalities, features, and their hierarchies
are organized in table \ref{tab:ffh}.

\section{Additional capabilities identified for real-world fuel cycle transition scenario}
From Brown et al. \cite{brown_identification_2016}, I identified two additional functionalities -
modeling discrete, real-world reactor fleets and operational history; modeling liquid-fueled
reactors with continuous reprocessing.

\subsection{Modeling discrete, real-world reactor fleets}
For modeling real-world nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios, the initial
condition (e.g. existing fissile inventory, existing reactor fleet) is important
to understand transition strategy, such as advanced reactor deployment
scheme. This requires the \gls{NFCS} to correctly model the current fleet and its
remaining lifetime. The purpose of a fuel cycle is to produce power, thus the objective
function of a fuel cycle simulation is generally power demand, and a transition
scenario involves advanced reactor (fast-spectrum reactors) filling in the
gap of decommissioned \glspl{LWR}.
Once the energy supply of the current fleet is calculated,
the analyst can determine the deployment scheme of reactors to meet a certain
power demand. Thus, it is important for the \gls{NFCS} to be able to simulate
discrete, real-world reactor fleets to have an accurate deployment scheme to
meet power demand.

\subsubsection{Discrete reactor facilities}
\glspl{NFCS} like COSI 6 \cite{meyer_new_2009}, EVOLCODE \cite{alvaerz-velarde_validation_2014},
FAMILY21,
do have discrete facility modeling capabilities, while ORION \cite{},
DESAE2.2\cite{tsibulskiy_desae_2006}, and VISION \cite{jacobson_verifiable_2010} does not \cite{boucher_international_2010}.


\subsubsection{Past work on modeling real-world fleets}


Only one published study is done modeling the current U.S. nuclear fleet,
using ORION \cite{sunny_transition_2015}. This is done using 





\subsection{Modeling liquid-fueled reactors with continuous reprocessing}
\glspl{MSR} reactor designs have recently gained attention due to it being a
potentially safer, more efficient, and sustainable form of nuclear power
\cite{serp_molten_2014}. Multiple companies in the U.S. are now pursuing
commercialization of \gls{MSR} design reactors, such as Tranasatomic \cite{transatomic_technical_2016}
, Terrapower, Terrestrial \cite{leblanc_18-_2017}, and
Thorcon \cite{dolan_19-_2017}. Other parties such as China (TMSR-LF \cite{dai_17-_2017}) 
and the European Union (MSFR \cite{heuer_towards_2014}, MOSART \cite{ignatiev_molten_2014})
are developing \gls{MSR} designs.

However, modeling \glspl{MSR} is difficult due to its online reprocessing regime.
The material flow in and out of the reactor is continuous and dynamic, as well as the
composition inside the core.
The neutronics and depletion calculations have to be performed continuously while
the composition of the fuel changes. Reactor physics and depletion calculations
on the \gls{MSR} have been done, notably by 
 Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers who developed
ChemTriton \cite{powers_new_2013}, a python script that drives SCALE,
to perform semi-continuous reprocessing of the fuel \cite{powers_inventory_2014, betzler_fuel_2018}.
However, there is no existing \gls{NFCS} that has the capability to model \glspl{MSR}
due to the large computational burden associated with frequent depletion calculations.

[that's where I come in]
