\section{SaltProc}
\label{sec:saltproc}

SaltProc is an on-line reprocessing simulation
driver for SERPENT2 \cite{leppanen_serpent_2015} developed by Andrei Rykhlevskii,
for simulating liquid-fueled \gls{MSR} operation \cite{rykhlevskii_arfc/saltproc:_2018}.
SaltProc uses a semi-continuous approach to simulate
continuous \gls{MSR} material feed and removal \cite{rykhlevskii_online_2017}.
It is coded in Python (compatible with both Python 2 and 3), and
records feed, removal, and in-core isotopic history in an HDF5 \cite{the_hdf_group_hierarchical_1997} database.

SaltProc's structure and capabilities are similar to that of the
ChemTriton tool for SCALE, developed at ORNL \cite{betzler_molten_2017}.
The computationally heavy work - Monte Carlo neutron transport and
burnup calculations - is done in SERPENT, while SaltProc parses through
the output material compositions, processes the fuel (removal and feed),
and creates a new SERPENT input file. The user can specify removal
rates, feed rates, and removal efficiencies for each isotope. At each
timestep, the following stream composition vectors are recorded in the database:
\begin{itemize}
	\item depleted core
	\item depleted core after reprocessing
	\item removal stream (reprocessed elements)
	\item feed stream
\end{itemize}


The logical flow of SaltProc is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:SaltProc}.
Initially, SaltProc reads a user-defined SERPENT 2 input file that
contains parameters such as  geometry, non-fuel component composition,
neutron population, criticality cycles, depletion time, total power, and boundary conditions.
SERPENT 2 then performs neutron transport and depletion calculations and 
returns the number density of the depleted fuel. SaltProc then reads the
depleted composition, writes the composition in the database, processes
the depleted material according to a user-defined scheme, and then
outputs a new fuel composition input card for SERPENT 2. This again
is then read by SERPENT 2 and the cycle continues until the user-defined
timestep is reached.

One of the benefits of having a semi-continuous external driver for
SERPENT 2 is that the user can set up SaltProc so that the density
of a certain isotope in the fuel remains constant. In other words,
the feed rate can vary over time to meet a certain `quality' of the fuel.
Also, using a Monte Carlo code such as SEPRENT allows users to vary
geometric fidelity, from a single cell model to a full core model.

\subsection{Use in this work}
SaltProc's output (in HDF5 \cite{the_hdf_group_hierarchical_1997} format) can be imported through a \Cyclus
module to mimic the \gls{MSR} feed and removal
behavior throughout its lifetime. The composition in the core is
not important here since the data of interest in a system-level \gls{NFC} simulation
is the material flow in and out of the reactor. This method can
effectively model \glspl{MSR} in a large system-scale \gls{NFC}
simulation without significant computational burden for the \gls{NFC} simulation at run-time.
