The scope of this work includes development and demonstration of
various methods and tools to leverage \Cyclus' existing
capabilities to model and simulate real-world nuclear fuel cycle
transition scenarios involving advanced reactor technologies.


\section{Background}
Increasing climate change concerns have directed attention
to nuclear energy, which produces reliable baseload energy
with negligible CO$_2$ emission. To reduce CO$_2$ emissions,
the world will have to reduce fossil fuel power plants.
Also, the world energy demand is expected to increase
(28\% growth between 2015 and 2040 \cite{conti_international_2016}).
Given the two circumstances,
nuclear power is expected to play a crucial role in the world energy portfolio.

However, concerns of the accumulating \gls{UNF} inventory,
safety of the current reactor fleet, and the availability of
uranium resources create a negative public perception of
nuclear energy and its sustainability.

Advanced fuel cycles that recycle nuclear fuel 
provide an opportunity for solving those concerns while
meeting energy demand. For the collective goal of transitioning
into advanced fuel cycles, the \gls{ANS} \gls{FCWMD} has identified
three grand challenges \cite{huff_message_2017}, listed below. The grand
challenges are identified challenges that members of the
society collectively agree need to be resolved by
2030 in order to help solve some of the economic, sociological,
or political issues that the nuclear society face \cite{american_nuclear_society_ans_2017}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Establish used nuclear fuel recycling associated with the
	``most promising'' fuel cycles that are economically competitive
	with current electricity production.
	\item Leverage the findings of the U.S. \gls{DOE}'s Evaluation
	and Screening Study to reconsider the U.S. approach to the whole
	nuclear fuel cycle, and publicly establish the ``most promising''
	nuclear fuel cycles and address some of the stretched ``truths''
	about some fuel cycles.
	\item Establish a logical incremental timeline toward a pilot
	and full-scale recycling facility for current reactors, and
	transition to future reactors from the ``most promising'' fuel cycles.
\end{enumerate}

The three grand challenges can be summarized as a need to
identify and plan for a ``most promising'' fuel cycle, while
accurately calculating its impacts.
In 2011, the \gls{DOE} commissioned a report
in order to plan the U.S. nuclear future.
The report by Wigeland et al. identified potential fuel cycle groups and compared them
to find the most `promising' fuel cycles \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}.
The objective of the evaluation was to provide information about the
potential benefits and challenges of nuclear fuel cycle options, in order to
guide the \gls{DOE} \gls{FCRD} program.

However, this study evaluated fuel cycle statically, such that the
material flow and reactor deployment were evaluated at equilibrium.
Therefore, the study did not take into account the dynamic
changes in fuel demand and reactor deployment or the
previously existing fleet. Static fuel cycle analyses
fail to capture the utilization of previously existing inventory.
Thus, for a more comprehensive
and realistic
evaluation of a fuel cycle, fuel cycle analyses
must include the transition from a previous fleet to
the intended fuel cycle. Analysis of fuel
cycle transition scenarios
can more accurately calculate the dynamic material demands
in a transition into a new fuel cycle, thus helps outline
fuel cycle \gls{RD} and facility deployment roadmap.

Given this gap, a simulation tool capable of accurately
calculating the metrics of a fuel cycle transition scenario
is essential for solving these grand challenges. This work
will demonstrate capabilities of a system-level analysis
tool, \Cyclus. I developed \texttt{cyclus-input-gen} to
ease \Cyclus input generation of historic nuclear operation.
I also developed \texttt{saltproc\_reactor} to model
\glspl{MSR} in \Cyclus. These added capabilities will streamline
modeling of transition scenarios as well as allow
\Cyclus to model fuel cycles involving \glspl{MSR}.


\subsection{The nuclear fuel cycle}
The nuclear fuel cycle is the complete nuclear energy
system from mining to disposal \cite{tsoulfanidis_nuclear_2013}.
A common goal of
a \gls{NFC} is to produce power economically, while minimizing
waste and natural resource used. Other specialized goals of \gls{NFC}s may involve
weapons material production or repository burden reduction through transmutation.
The discharge \gls{UNF} from the reactors is eventually sent back to facilities for
either recycling or disposal.

In 2011, the \gls{DOE} commissioned a report
in order to plan the U.S. nuclear future.
The report by Wigeland et al. identified potential fuel cycle groups and compared them
to find the most `promising' fuel cycle \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}.
The objective of the evaluation was to provide information about the
potential benefits and challenges of nuclear fuel cycle options, in order to
guide \gls{DOE} \gls{FCRD} program.
This study identified 40 fuel cycle groups, categorized by the extent of recycling
(no recycle, limited recycle, and continuous recycle), fuel composition
(e.g. thorium-U233, uranium-plutonium), and the type of reactors (fast/thermal critical
reactors, sub-critical \gls{EDS}).

Fuel Cycles can be mainly categorized by their treatment of \gls{UNF}. A
fuel cycle that disposes all \gls{UNF} generated is a once-through fuel cycle.
If the \gls{UNF} is reprocessed, a fuel cycle is categorized either as a
closed fuel cycle, or a fuel cycle with limited recycling, depending on
the number of time the fuel passes through a reactor.


\subsubsection{Once-through fuel cycle}

In a once-through cycle, nuclear fuel is used once and then sent to
storage without further reprocessing \cite{tsoulfanidis_nuclear_2013}.
This cycle is often called the open fuel cycle, and is the current cycle for
most nations with nuclear energy (e.g. U.S., Korea, Finland, Sweden).

This fuel cycle begins with mining of uranium or thorium ore, which is extracted from the
ground. The mined ore is milled to form yellowcake ($U_3O_8$).
The yellowcake is then either converted to $UF_6$ and enriched, or converted
to $UO_2$ directly. This is because some reactor designs (e.g. \gls{CANDU} designs\cite{torgerson_candu_2006})
can operate with natural uranium, while others (e.g. \glspl{LWR}) need
higher-than-natural levels of uranium-235. The processed $UO_2$ is
then fabricated to pellets and loaded into fuel assemblies.

Once the fuel is depleted in the reactor, it is put in on-site pools to cool down.
After cooling, the \gls{UNF}
is stored in dry casks as interim storage, destined to be sent to a geologic repository
for permanent disposal.

\subsubsection{Closed fuel cycle}
In a closed fuel cycle, the \gls{UNF} is recycled to be reused
in a nuclear reactor. Recycling has two major
benefits: increased fuel utilization and reduction of repository
burden.

A typical composition of \gls{UNF} discharged from an \gls{LWR}
is approximately 95\% uranium, 0.9\% plutonium, 0.1\%
minor actinides, and 4\% fission products \cite{feiveson_spent_2011}.
The uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides have the capability
to produce power through fission. Thus, every group except the
fission products can be separated to create new fuel for other reactors.

Additionally, repository capacity is constrained mostly by decay heat
load and radioactivity, meaning that removal of the high-activity
isotopes leads to a more efficient utilization of the repository
capacity. Short-lived fission products (e.g. cesium, strontium) contribute
to significant heat and radioactivity in the first 100 years of \gls{UNF} disposal,
and long-lived minor actinides (americium, plutonium),
contribute to longer-term heat and radioactivity \cite{wigeland_separations_2006},
as shown in figure \ref{fig:decay_heat}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

	\caption{Decay heat contributions in \gls{UNF} from a \gls{PWR} irradiated
		to 50 GWd/MTHM. Reproduced from Wigeland, 2006 \cite{wigeland_separations_2006}.}
	\label{fig:decay_heat}
\end{figure}


There are two major reprocessing technologies:
methods that use low-temperature chemical separation
using organic solvents (e.g. PUREX \cite{baumgaertner_purex_1976}), and
methods that use high-temperature molten salts and metals, like pyroprocessing
\cite{laidler_development_1997}. These methods separate the \gls{UNF}
into different streams, which are then sent to either a \gls{HLW} repository
(fission products) or an appropriate fuel fabrication facility (plutonium).

Different closed fuel cycles use different elemental groups for recycled
fuel fabrication. For example, the PUREX process is used in La Hague in France
\cite{schneider_spent_2008}, THORP in the U.K \cite{riley_technology_1998},
Mayak in Russia, and Rokkasho in Japan to separated plutonium and uranium
\cite{birkett_recent_2005}. The plutonium is mixed with either depleted
uranium (tails) or reprocessed uranium to produce \gls{MOX}.

Closed fuel cycles
generally involve fast-spectrum reactors to control TRU inventory.
A fast-spectrum reactor can be designed to either burn (reduce TRU),
breed (produce more TRU), or break-even (maintain TRU amount).
Selection of the fast-spectrum reactor design depends on the
goal of the deploying institution.


\subsubsection{Fuel cycle with limited recycling}
Fuel cycle with limited recycling is defined by the recycling of \gls{UNF}
for a limited number of times. 
The goals for recycling the irradiated fuel include
reusing the separated material in a nuclear reactor and 
separating long-lived highly radioactive elements
for repository burden reduction \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}.
The difference
between limited recycling and `closed' fuel cycles (continuous
recycling) is the number of cycles fuel might undergo transmutation.
In `closed' fuel cycle, the fuel undergoes many to an infinite number
of cycles, through constant reprocessing.


\subsection{Fuel cycle transition scenarios}
In a fuel cycle transition, an initial fleet of technology and corresponding
fuel cycle strategies dynamically evolve into a different final state \cite{oecd_nuclear_2009}.
In this work, I focus on the transition from
once-through fuel cycles to closed fuel
cycles through the progressive replacement of previous technology
(i.e. \glspl{LWR}) with an advanced technology (i.e. reprocessing
and fast-spectrum reactors). Other transition scenarios include
a general transition into a different fuel cycle (evaluation group
defined by Wigeland et al.), to a mixture of fuel cycles, or
a complete nuclear energy phaseout.

In this work, I analyze the material feasibility of fuel
cycle transition scenarios, which is characterized by whether
all nuclear reactors received fuel on time.

The fuel demand is determined by two factors - nuclear energy demand
and the nation's fuel cycle strategy.
The nuclear energy demand determines the construction
and operation
schedule of new reactors, and the fuel demand is
calculated accordingly.
Fuel cycle strategies determine the isotopic
requirements of the fuel cycle transition scenario. For example,
if the transition drives toward a U-Pu \gls{MOX} fuel cycle,
plutonium inventory dominates the timescale and feasibility of transition.

Once the expected fuel demand is calculated,
the initial condition - current fissile material inventory
and number of reactors (and their remaining lifetimes) - determines
the material feasibility and timescale of a transition scenario.
If a transition scenario is infeasible (i.e. fissile source is lacking) or delayed,
the transition can be `loosened', by delaying deployment
of advanced reactors. The energy demand can instead be met by additional
deployment of previous reactor technology (e.g. \glspl{LWR}),
thereby increasing transition timescale but reducing the
intensity of fissile material demand.

Since fuel cycles involve multiple facilities,
transition scenario analyses require
dynamic tracking of materials and facilities.
The dynamic tracking will calculate available nuclear material
inventory as well as the demand for the nuclear
material.

\subsection{Real-world fuel cycle simulation}
Real-world fuel cycle simulation captures the non-uniformity of
reactor facilities in the real world. Most work on fuel cycle
simulation assumes a uniform fleet of reactors with identical
parameters, such as core size and power capacity. This simplification
does not reflect the current state of nuclear operation, in which
reactors vary in power capacity and core size, leading
to errors in \gls{UNF} inventory and power demand calculations.
Capturing the real-world nuclear fleet requires discrete
modeling of facilities, with unique parameters for each facility
as well as discrete material and facility event (e.g. refuel outage,
decommission) modeling.

\section{Nuclear fuel cycle simulators}
\glspl{NFCS} are system-level analysis tools
that allow tracking of material flow in an \gls{NFC}. Their
functionalities include, but are not limited to, isotopic decay,
depletion calculations, and separation of material streams.
The goal of a \gls{NFCS} is to calculate \textit{metrics} - quantitative
measures of performance that can be compared among fuel cycle
options \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}.

The obtained metrics can then be optimized to the interests
of different stakeholders. Passerini et al. \cite{passerini_systematic_2014}
identified categories and criteria for \gls{NFC} optimization and
weighted the criteria for different stakeholders (e.g. Industry, laboratories).
This approach can help decide which metric is important to stakeholders
and optimize the fuel cycle for that metric.

Table \ref{tab:fcs} lists the \glspl{NFCS}
considered in this section. The listed \glspl{NFCS}
generally focus on one functionality
(e.g. multi-regional analysis, detailed isotopic tracking,
demand-driven deployment, cost analysis, sensitivity study)
but lack in the flexibility to perform other
functionalities \cite{huff_next_2010}. In
other words, no \gls{NFCS} has all the functionalities to
perform the superset of analysis types.

\section{Objectives}

This thesis demonstrates and extends the real-world \gls{NFC} transition
scenario modeling capabilities in \Cyclus. 
The goal of this thesis to
develop tools that leverage \Cyclus' modularity to
add capabilities required for modeling real-world
fuel cycle transition scenarios. The added capabilities are then
demonstrated through \gls{NFC} transition scenarios relevant to France and the United
States.

\section{Motivation}

There are two major motivations for accurately simulating
real-world \gls{NFC} transition scenarios.
First, \gls{NFC} transitions require strategized reactor
and fuel cycle deployment to meet fuel demand for advanced systems.
A simulation tool must be able to calculate the material
and facility throughput requirements of the transition scenario.
Second, \gls{NFC} transition scenarios need to optimize
existing investment and technology. For example, with an \gls{NFCS},
analysts can determine the best reactor technology
to leverage current \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} inventory in a nation.


\subsection{Capabilities required for modeling transition scenarios}
To meet the two goals mentioned above, a \gls{NFCS} needs to have
specific capabilities.
A study by Brown et al. \cite{brown_identification_2016}
identified nine common functionalities of \glspl{NFCS} for modeling
transition scenarios - material compositions, deployment of fuel
cycle facilities, front-end facility models, separations and material
recycle facilities, reactor facilities, back-end features, starting
the new fuel cycle, materials queuing and prioritization under
capacity limitations, and energy demand algorithms. Brown et al.
categorize each feature into three tiers - \texbf{basic}, \texbf{integral},
and \textbf{exemplary}. \textbf{Basic} features are essential in modeling a fuel
cycle, such as conservation of mass in composition changes,
facility deployment and retirement, and modeling of front-end
facilities like an enrichment facility.
\texbf{Integral} features are
needed to bind the basic functionalities to process
transition scenarios. Examples of \texbf{integral} features are
demand-driven deployment of fuel cycle facilities and
material prioritization.
Finally, \textbf{exemplary} features enable exploration
of various sensitivities and technology choices, and are
not essential. \textbf{Exemplary} features include discrete isotope
tracking and radioactive decay.


The functionalities, features, and their hierarchies
are organized in table \ref{tab:ffh}.

\subsection{Additional capabilities identified for real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios}
I have identified three additional functionalities beyond those identified by Brown et al. \cite{brown_identification_2016}
for modeling real-world \gls{NFC} transition scenario -
integrating historical data, modeling discrete facilities and events, and modeling liquid-fueled
reactors with continuous reprocessing.


\subsubsection{Integrating historical data}
In modeling real-world nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios, initial
conditions (e.g. existing fissile inventory, existing reactor fleet) 
strongly impact the transition scenario parameters, such as reactor deployment
schemes, fuel types, and reactor designs.
This requires the \gls{NFCS} to correctly model the current fleet and its
remaining lifetime. The purpose of a fuel cycle is to produce power, thus the objective
function of a fuel cycle simulation is generally to meet a certain power demand.
Once the required installed capacity of the current fleet is calculated,
the analyst can determine the deployment scheme of future reactors to meet a future
power demand. 

\subsubsection{Past work on modeling real-world fleets}
Modeling real-world fleets requires data about the current existing fleet,
such as power capacity, first criticality date, core size, and expected shutdown date.

A study by Sunny et al. modeled the current U.S. nuclear fleet
using ORION \cite{sunny_transition_2015}. However, the fleet represented
by Sunny et al. is far from
modeling real-world U.S. nuclear fleet since it assumed a deployed \gls{LWR} capacity
of 90 GWe in 2015, which decreases by 5 GWe every year starting from 2030,
meaning that no consideration is given to the actual shutdown dates of
existing reactors. This simplification stems from ORION modeling reactors as
a fleet governed by a power demand, not as discrete facilities.

Another U.S. \gls{NFC} transition scenario simulation by Worrall \cite{worrall_utilization_2013}
models actual U.S. nuclear fleets using the \gls{PRIS} database, which is the same
method used for this work. However, the analysis is done using an extensive
network of spreadsheets, and not a \gls{NFCS}.

Modeling real-world fleets is possible in \Cyclus, for two
reasons. First, \Cyclus models
discrete facilities with their own events and material flow.
Second, \Cyclus has a text-based input file structure, meaning that
the input files (and thus the scenario) can be generated from 
a database and a script, as in this work.


\subsubsection{Discrete reactor facility modeling}
Discrete modeling of reactors allows a higher resolution of the power supply and
material flow. In the real world, especially in the United States, existing
reactors do not have the same power output or core size. This means that
lumping the reactor fleet together causes a loss in accuracy. The loss in
accuracy occurs by not capturing phenomena such as anisotropic fresh fuel
fabrication requirements, spent fuel isotopics of a fleet of reactors
with greatly varying burnups, and chaotic isotopic balance in fuel
cycles involving multiple recycling passes \cite{huff_next_2010}.
COSI 6 \cite{eschbach_new_2013}, EVOLCODE \cite{alvarez-velarde_validation_2014},
FAMILY21 \cite{oecd_nuclear_2009},
have discrete facility modeling capabilities, while
DESAE2.2\cite{tsibulskiy_desae_2006}, and VISION \cite{jacobson_verifiable_2010} do
not \cite{boucher_international_2010}.

Similarly, most \glspl{NFCS} do not treat disruption events (lack of fuel supply
or decommissioning of a reactor)
discretely. For example, ORION shuts down the entire simulation if there
is a lack of fuel supply, and cannot decommission reactors mid-cycle.
DESAE `borrows' lacking fuel from storage (leaving a
negative mass value) instead of shutting down the reactor \cite{mccarthy_benchmark_2012}.
COSI models reactors operating in sync \cite{boucher_benchmark_2012}.


\subsubsection{Modeling liquid-fueled reactors with continuous reprocessing}
\label{sec:msr}
\gls{MSR} designs have recently gained attention due to 
their potential to be 
safer, more efficient in heat conversion, and sustainable \cite{serp_molten_2014}.
Multiple companies in the U.S. are now pursuing
commercialization of \gls{MSR} design reactors, such as Terrapower, Terrestrial \cite{leblanc_18_2017}, and
Thorcon \cite{jorgensen_19_2017}. Other parties such as China (TMSR-LF \cite{dai_17_2017}) ,
France (REBUS-3700 \cite{mourogov_potentialities_2006}),
and the European Union (MSFR \cite{heuer_towards_2014}, MOSART \cite{ignatiev_molten_2014})
are developing \gls{MSR} designs.

However, modeling an \gls{MSR} is challenging due to its on-line reprocessing
and continuously flowing fuel.
The material flow in and out of the reactor is continuous and dynamic, as well as the
composition inside the core.
Neutronics and depletion calculations have to be performed continuously while
the composition of the fuel changes via depletion and reprocessing.
Reactor physics and depletion calculations
on \glspl{MSR} have been done. For example,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers developed
ChemTriton \cite{powers_new_2013}, a python script that drives SCALE,
to perform semi-continuous reprocessing of the fuel \cite{powers_inventory_2014, betzler_fuel_2018}.
However, modeling \glspl{MSR} in an \gls{NFCS} is a challenge
due to the significant computational burden associated with frequent depletion calculations.

This challenge of large computational time in an \gls{NFCS} can be overcome by `outsourcing' the computationally
heavy work to the higher-fidelity reactor physics and depletion codes. 
In such a workflow, the high-fidelity code simulates a certain
\gls{MSR} design for its lifetime, while recording the history of its feed and waste in a
database. A \Cyclus facility module reads this database and mimics the feed and removal
behavior listed in the database, effectively modeling \gls{MSR} material flow.
This allows \gls{MSR} modeling in a larger-scale system analysis without heavy computational
burden, while securing fidelity of the depletion calculation.



\section{Methods}
This thesis accomplishes the objective in three steps. 
First, a benchmark showed good agreement with other
fuel cycle simulation tools. \footnote{These results have been
submitted for publication in Annals of Nuclear Energy.}
Second, I identified and developed the tools and methods necessary
for modeling and simulating real-world transition scenarios.
Finally, I constructed and ran fuel cycle transition scenarios
relevant to France and the United States to demonstrate
and verify the capability.

\subsection{Benchmark study}
A previous study by Feng et al. \cite{feng_standardized_2016} validates existing 
\glspl{NFCS} in a fuel cycle transition scenario, in which an \gls{LWR} fleet
transitions into an \gls{SFR} fleet with continuous reprocessing. This 
study compares four well-known \glspl{NFCS}
DYMOND \cite{yacout_modeling_2005},
VISION \cite{jacobson_verifiable_2010},
ORION \cite{gregg_analysis_2012}, and
MARKAL \cite{shay_epa_2006}. The results from each code were
compared to a set of `model solutions' that were generated
from a spreadsheet for various metrics (e.g. fuel loading
in reactor, \gls{UNF} inventory). I reproduced the transition
scenario in \Cyclus, and compare the \Cyclus results with those
from the model solutions.

\subsection{Tool development}
In order to model real-world transition into an advanced
fuel cycle, I developed two major tools. First, I developed a python package \texttt{cyclus-input-gen},
which includes the submodule \texttt{from\_pris}
that automates extraction from the curated \gls{IAEA} \gls{PRIS} database
\cite{iaea_nuclear_2018}. Second, I developed \texttt{saltproc\_Reactor}that models \glspl{MSR}
in \Cyclus using a database generated from a high-fidelity \gls{MSR} depletion calculation.

\subsection{Real-world fuel cycle transition scenario simulation}
I constructed the fuel cycle transition scenario for France and the United States.
I made different assumptions for the two scenarios to account for each nation's different goals,
initial conditions (i.e. currently existing fleet, \gls{UNF} inventory), and their potential reactor
technology. I used \texttt{from\_pris} to construct the initial \Cyclus input file,
followed by iterations to account for new reactor deployment. The workflow driving the analyses is shown in diagram \ref{diag:workflow}.

The structure of this thesis is as follows. In chapter 2, I review other fuel cycle simulation
tools and their gaps, and explain the unique capability \Cyclus
has for transition scenario simulation.
Chapter 3 discusses the design and
development of capabilities needed for \gls{NFC} transition simulation.
Chapter 4 describes the results from the benchmark study, in which \Cyclus results are compared
to results from other fuel cycle simulation tools.
Chapter 5 and 6 details the results from the France and United States fuel cycle
transition scenarios, in which each nation's \gls{LWR} fleet transitions into
a fast reactor fleet with continuous reprocessing.
