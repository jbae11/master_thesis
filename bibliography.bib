	abstract = {In the 1960s and 70s, great interest developed in the thorium fuel cycle as a supplement to limited uranium reserves. A great amount of work was carried out and many interesting developments resulted, among which were prototype high temperature reactors. It was shown that thorium could be used practically in any type of existing reactor. These initiatives have been virtually brought to a halt for various reasons, except in India, which has continued with its thorium activities. Recently however, new considerations have revived interest in thorium. An overview of the specificities of the thorium fuel cycle was carried out and the most interesting projects launched in the 1960s are recalled. The new concepts are analyzed briefly and some lines of thought for the future are proposed.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the {ASTRID} project at {CEA}, core design studies are performed at {CEA} with the {AREVA} and {EDF} support. At the stage of the project, pre-conceptual design studies are conducted in accordance with {GEN} {IV} reactors criteria, in particularly for safety improvements. An improved safety for a sodium cooled reactor requires revisiting many aspects of the design and is a rather lengthy process in current design approach. Two types of cores are under evaluation, one classical derivated from the {SFR} V2B and one more challenging called {CFV} (low void effect core) with a large gain on the sodium void effect. The {SFR} V2b core have the following specifications : a very low burn-up reactivity swing (due to a small cycle reactivity loss) and a reduced sodium void effect with regard to past designs such as the {EFR} (around 2\$ minus). Its performances are an average burn-up of 100 {GWd}/t, and an internal conversion ratio equal to one given a very good behavior of this core during a control rod withdrawal transient). The {CFV} with its specific design offers a negative sodium void worth while maintaining core performances. In accordance of {ASTRID} needs for demonstration those cores are 1500 {MWth} power (600 {MWe}). This paper will focus on the {CFV} pre-conceptual design of the core and S/A, and the performances in terms of safety will be evaluated on different transient scenario like {ULOF}, in order to assess its intrinsic behavior compared to a more classical design like V2B core. The gap in term of margin to a severe accident due to a loss of flow initiator underlines the potential capability of this type of core to enhance prevention of severe accident in accordance to safety demonstration.

	abstract = {As part of a nuclear fuel cycle evaluation and screening (E\&S) study, widely ranging thorium fuel cycle options were evaluated, and their performance characteristics and challenges to implementation were compared to those of other nuclear fuel cycle options based on criteria specified by the Nuclear Energy Office of the U.S. Department of Energy. The evaluated nuclear fuel cycles included the once-through, limited, and continuous recycle options using critical or externally driven nuclear energy systems. The E\&S study found that the continuous recycle of 233U/Th in fuel cycles using either thermal or fast reactors is an attractive promising fuel cycle option with high effective fuel resource utilization and low waste generation, but they did not perform quite as well as the continuous recycle of Pu/U using a fast critical system, which was identified as one of the most promising fuel cycle options in the E\&S study. This is because compared to their uranium counterparts, the thorium-based systems tended to have higher radioactivity in the short term ( 100 years postirradiation), because of differences in the fission product yield curves, and in the long term (100 000 years postirradiation), because of the decay of 233U and daughters, and because of higher mass flow rates due to lower discharge burnups. Some of the thorium-based systems also require enriched uranium support, which tends to be detrimental to resource utilization and waste generation metrics. Finally, similar to the need to develop recycle fuel fabrication, fuels separations, and fast reactors for the most promising options using Pu/U recycle, the future thorium-based fuel cycle options with continuous recycle would also require such capabilities; however, their deployment challenges are expected to be greater since past development of such facilities has not reached a comparable level of maturity.},

	abstract = {Today's nuclear technology has principally been based on the use of fissile U-235 and Pu-239. While the natural thorium isotope Th-232 can finally be transformed to a fissile U-233 nucleus following a thermal neutron capture reaction, the existence of thorium in the nature and its potential use in the nuclear technology were not unfortunately into account with a sufficient importance. This was probably because of the geological availability of natural resources of thorium and uranium. Global distributions of thorium and uranium reserves clearly indicate that in general some developed countries such as the {USA}, Canada, Australia have considerable uranium reserves and contrarily only some developing countries such as Brazil, Turkey, India, Egypt have considerable thorium reserves as being totally about 70 \% of the global reserve. All technical parameters obtained from the studies on thorium fuel cycle during the last 50 years indicate that thorium fuel cycle can be used in most of reactor types already operated. In addition, accelerated-driven hybrid systems promise to use the thorium based nuclear fuels. So, thorium will probably be a nuclear material much more valuable than uranium in the future. For this reason, all developing countries having thorium reserves should focus their technological attentions to the evaluation of their national thorium resources like in the case of India. In this paper a brief story on the studies of thorium and its potential use in the future energy production technology have been summarized.},

In total, 1449 publications are identified, with the most prevalent topics being Reprocessing and Waste Management, Molten Salt Reactors, Fuels, and Light Water Reactors. In aggregate, reactor-oriented categories (five in all) comprise 45.5\% of publications. The {US} is the most dominant thorium-publishing nation with 916 publications, followed next by India with 82 and then eight other countries having 25 publications or more. National laboratories have contributed 45\% of thorium publications, with roughly equal shares of the balance split between government agencies, universities, and corporations/companies. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the {US} accounts for more than a quarter of all publications. Specialized criteria are developed and applied to identify some of the most important, or “keystone”, publications for each category. Across the different categories, and for the study of thorium fuel cycles overall, published research reached an intermediate peak in the 1970s followed by a sharp decline in the 1980s and 1990s; however, interest has been revived moving into the 21st century.},

	abstract = {This paper compares the radiotoxicity of thorium-based and uranium-based spent nuclear fuels and reprocessing wastes to inform evaluation of whether thorium-based fuels are significantly less radiotoxic than uranium-based fuels, as has been claimed at times in the technical literature. A consistent approach for calculating the radiotoxicity is established for four oxide fuel types in a pressurized water reactor: low-enrichment uranium, uranium with plutonium fissile material, thorium with 233U fissile material, and thorium with plutonium fissile material. The results of the calculations are presented to display the radiotoxicity trends and are analyzed to determine (a) what underlies the indicated radiotoxicity trends for decay times from 1 year to 20 million years and (b) factors that may have led to erroneous conclusions concerning the comparative radiotoxicity of thorium- and uranium-based fuels. The overall conclusion is that the ingestion radiotoxicity of thorium-based fuels containing 233U or plutonium fissile materials is similar to the radiotoxicity of uranium-based fuels containing 235U or plutonium fissile materials but that within this overall similarity there are significant differences in radiotoxicity in specific eras during decay.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) with Th-233U fuel cycle attracts more and more attention with its excellent performance such as desirable breeding capacity, low waste production and high inherent safety. Considering the fact that there is no available 233U in the nature, it is necessary to analyze the fuel transition from enriched 235U/Th to 233U/Th and then give a flexible transition scenario for a graphite-moderated {MSR}. By employing an in-house developed tool which is based on {SCALE}6.1, two scenarios, a Breeding and Burning (B\&B) scenario and a Pre-breeding scenario, are studied. The evolution of the inventories of main nuclides, net 233U production and isothermal temperature coefficient are presented and discussed in the B\&B scenario. It is found that the fuel transition can be achieved smoothly by using enriched uranium with greater than 40\% concentration of 235U. The fuel transition can still be accomplished with 20\% enriched uranium but takes a long double time of about 79 years. Meanwhile, we perform an analysis of the Pre-breeding scenario and conclude that it is efficient to produce 233U and the double time ranges from 2.07 years for the 10-day reprocessing to 10.7 years for the 180-day reprocessing. A comparison of these two scenarios is conducted, which indicates that the B\&B scenario is more favorable than the Pre-breeding scenario from the aspect of resource utilization efficiency. Finally, a combined three-stage program for developing Th-based {MSRs} is proposed.},

	abstract = {There is currently a renewed interest in molten salt reactors, due to recent conceptual developments on fast neutron spectrum molten salt reactors ({MSFRs}) using fluoride salts. It has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid-fueled fast neutron systems with a unique potential (large negative temperature and void coefficients, lower fissile inventory, no initial criticality reserve, simplified fuel cycle, wastes reduction etc.) and is thus one of the reference reactors of the Generation {IV} International Forum. In the {MSFR}, the liquid fuel processing is part of the reactor where a small side stream of the molten salt is processed for fission product removal and then returned to the reactor. Because of this characteristic, the {MSFR} can operate with widely varying fuel compositions, so that the {MSFR} concept may use as initial fissile load, 233U or enriched uranium or also the transuranic elements currently produced by light water reactors. This paper addresses the characteristics of these different launching modes of the {MSFR} and the Thorium fuel cycle, in terms of safety, proliferation, breeding, and deployment capacities of these reactor configurations. To illustrate the deployment capacities of the {MSFR} concept, a French nuclear deployment scenario is finally presented, demonstrating that launching the Thorium fuel cycle is easily feasible while closing the current fuel cycle and optimizing the long-term waste management via stockpile incineration in {MSRs}.},

	url = {https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/74324},
	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}) technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors ({FR}) with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The {MSFR} emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the {MSFR}. Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The {MSFR} also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The {MSFR} inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional {FRs}, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the {MSFR} presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the {MSFR} allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the {MSFR} out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current {MSFR} conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the {MSFR} promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

	abstract = {The concept of the molten salt reactor ({MSR}) refuses to go away. The Generation-{IV} process lists the {MSR} as one of the six concepts to be considered for extending fuel resources. Good fuel utilization and good economics are required to meet the often-cited goal of 10 {TWe} globally and 1 {TWe} for the {US} by non-carbon energy sources in this century by nuclear fission. Strong incentives for the molten salt reactor design are its good fuel utilization, good economics, amazing fuel flexibility and promised large benefits. It can:• use thorium or uranium; • be designed with lots of graphite to have a fairly thermal neutron spectrum or without graphite moderator to have an epithermal neutron spectrum; • fission uranium isotopes and plutonium isotopes; • produces less long-lived wastes than today’s reactors by a factor of 10–100; • operate with non-weapon grade fissile fuel, or in suitable sites it can operate with enrichment between reactor-grade and weapon grade fissile fuel; • be a breeder or near breeder; • operate at temperature \&gt;1100 °C if carbon composites are successfully developed. Enhancing 232U content in the uranium to over 500 ppm makes the fuel undesirable for weapons, but it should not detract from its economic use in liquid fuel reactors: a big advantage in nonproliferation. Economics of the {MSR} are enhanced by operating at low pressure and high temperature and may even lead to the preferred route to hydrogen production. The cost of the electricity produced from low enriched fuel averaged over the life of the entire process, has been predicted to be about 10\% lower than that from {LWRs}, and 20\% lower for high-enriched fuel, with uncertainties of about 10\%. The development cost has been estimated at about 1 B\$ (e.g., a 100 M\$/year base program for 10 years) not including construction of a series of reactors leading up to the deployment of multiple commercial units at an assumed cost of 9 B\$ (450 M\$/year over 20 years). A benefit of liquid fuel is that smaller power reactors can faithfully test features of larger reactors, thereby reducing the number of steps to commercial deployment. Assuming electricity is worth \$ 50 per {MWe} h, then 50 years of 10 {TWe} power level would be worth 200 trillion dollars. If the {MSR} could be developed and proven for 10 B\$ and would save 10\% over its alternative, the total savings over 50 years would be 20 trillion dollars: a good return on investment even considering discounted future savings. The incentives for the molten salt reactor are so strong and its relevance to our energy policy and national security are so compelling that one asks, “Why has the reactor not already been developed?”},

Many countries worldwide contribute to this reactor technology, among which the European Union, France, Japan, Russia and the {USA}, and for the past few years China and India have also contributed. In general, the international R\&D focuses on three main lines of research. The {USA} focuses on the {FHR}, which will be a nearer-term application of liquid salt as a reactor coolant, while China also focuses on solid fuel reactors as a precursor to molten salt reactors with liquid fuel and a thermal neutron spectrum. The {EU}, France and Russia are focusing on the development of a fast spectrum molten salt reactor capable of either breeding or transmutation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Future research topics focus on liquid salt technology and materials behavior, the fuel and fuel cycle chemistry and modeling, and the numerical simulation and safety design aspects of the reactor. {MSR} development attracts more and more attention every year, because it is generally considered as most sustainable of the six Generation-{IV} designs with intrinsic safety features.

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}) are liquid-fuel reactors, in which the fuel is also the coolant and flows through the core. A particular configuration presented in this paper called the Molten Salt Fast Reactor consists in a Molten Salt Reactor with no moderator inside the core and a salt composition that leads to a fast neutron spectrum. Previous studies showed that this concept (previously called Thorium Molten Salt Reactor – Nonmoderated) has very promising characteristics. The liquid fuel implies a special reprocessing. Each day a small amount of the fuel salt is extracted from the core for on-site reprocessing. To study such a reactor, the materials evolution within the core has to be coupled to the reprocessing unit, since the latter cleans the salt quasi continuously and feeds the reactor. This paper details the issues associated to the numerical coupling of the core and the reprocessing. It presents how the chemistry is introduced inside the classical Bateman equation (evolution of nuclei within a neutron flux) in order to carry a numerical coupled study. To achieve this goal, the chemistry has to be modeled numerically and integrated to the equations of evolution. This paper presents how is it possible to describe the whole concept (reactor+reprocessing unit) by a system of equations that can be numerically solved. Our program is a connection between {MCNP} and a homemade evolution code called {REM}. Thanks to this tool; constraints on the fuel reprocessing were identified. Limits are specified to preserve the good neutronics properties of the {MSFR}. In this paper, we show that the limit rate for the reprocessing is 2.5l of fuel salt a day, which means that the fuel should be reprocessed within 7000days approximately if there is a specific way to control the redox potential of the salt. Finally, a last part of this paper analyzes the impact of chemical parameter uncertainties on the reprocessing performance.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor ({MSR}), as one of the six systems selected by the Generation {IV} International Forum ({GIF}) for future advantaged reactors research and development (R\&D), has excellent performances such as high inherent safety, desirable breeding capacity, low radioactive waste production, flexible fuel cycle and non-proliferation. Meanwhile, thorium, as an appealing alternative nuclear fuel to uranium, is more abundant than uranium in the earth’s crust. Realization of thorium fuel cycle in {MSRs} will greatly contribute to sustainable energy supply for global development. The objective of this paper is to analyze and evaluate thorium fuel utilization in a program in which {MSRs} are expected to be developed step by step. The program can be described as follows:1 The first stage is a converter reactor fueled with low enriched uranium. With limited processing based on current chemical partitioning technology and fuel-feeding techniques in the generation-I {MSR};2 The second stage is a 233U production reactor. By using the enriched uranium, it can produce 233U which does not exist in nature;3 The third stage is a thorium breeding reactor. It is a breeder reactor with Th/233U fuel cycle, and sustainable thorium utilization for energy production is expected to be eventually realized.By employing an in-house developed tool based on {SCALE}6.1, the performance of {MSR} fueled with low enriched uranium is firstly assessed. It is found that {MSR} is attractive regarding conversion ratio when compared with light water reactors. Then we illustrate the feasibility of 233U production in {MSR}. Enriched uranium with two enrichments are used as driver fuels to start {MSR} and produce 233U. The results show that 233U production can be achieved and the double time is about 79.1 years for 20\% enriched uranium and 28.3 years for 60\% enriched uranium. Finally, the performance of {MSR} based on pure Th/233U fuel cycle is evaluated. It is found that breeding fissile material is possible in {MSR} and the breeding ratio is desirable (1.049). Comparison of the three-stage {MSRs} is also conducted and the results indicate that the resource utilization efficiency is much higher in stage-{III} than that in the first two stages and much less minor actinides is produced in {MSR} operating on Th/233U fuel cycle than that in traditional light water reactor.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor ({MSR}), as one of the Generation {IV} advanced nuclear systems, has attracted a worldwide interest due to its excellent performances in safety, economics, sustainability, and proliferation resistance. The aim of this work is to provide and evaluate possible solutions to fissile 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and further the fuel transition to thorium fuel cycle in a thermal {MSR} by using plutonium partitioned from light water reactors spent fuel. By using an in-house developed tool, a breeding and burning (B\&B) scenario is first introduced and analyzed from the aspects of the evolution of main nuclides, net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production, spectrum shift, and temperature feedback coefficient. It can be concluded that such a Th/Pu to Th/233UTh/233U{\textbackslash}hbox \{Th\}/{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} transition can be accomplished by employing a relatively fast fuel reprocessing with a cycle time less than 60 days. At the equilibrium state, the reactor can achieve a conversion ratio of about 0.996 for the 60-day reprocessing period ({RP}) case and about 1.047 for the 10-day {RP} case. The results also show that it is difficult to accomplish such a fuel transition with limited reprocessing ({RP} is 180 days), and the reactor operates as a converter and burns the plutonium with the help of thorium. Meanwhile, a pre-breeding and burning ({PB}\&B) scenario is also analyzed briefly with respect to the net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and evolution of main nuclides. One can find that it is more efficient to produce 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} under this scenario, resulting in a double time varying from about 1.96 years for the 10-day {RP} case to about 6.15 years for the 180-day {RP} case.},

In the heterogeneous approach, minor actinides are loaded in specially designed targets assemblies which are located in the periphery of the core, in order to limit the impacts on core operations. In this paper, we compare the use of uranium and thorium dioxide as support matrix in which minor actinides are diluted in the target assemblies. Both {UO}2 and {ThO}2 exhibit sufficiently good irradiation behavior to withstand the long residence time associated with heterogeneous transmutation. Five different reprocessing strategies are compared in which some or all the elements in the blankets are reused after reprocessing. The impacts on core safety parameters and fuel cycle parameters are also evaluated for each case and it is found that using thorium as support matrix with reuse of uranium 233 leads to transmutation performances similar to the one obtained with the reuse of plutonium from uranium blankets with slightly lower global impacts on reactor operation and fuel cycle.},

The objective of this paper is to determine whether intermediate spectrum systems, having a majority of fission events occurring with incident neutron energies between 1 {eV} and 105 {eV}, perform as well as fast spectrum systems in this fuel cycle. The intermediate spectrum options analyzed include tight lattice heavy or light water-cooled reactors, continuously refueled molten salt reactors, and a sodium-cooled reactor with hydride fuel. All options were modeled in reactor physics codes to calculate their lattice physics, spectrum characteristics, and fuel compositions over time. Based on these results, detailed metrics were calculated to compare the fuel cycle performance. These metrics include waste management and resource utilization, and are binned to accommodate uncertainties. The performance of the intermediate systems for this self-sustaining thorium fuel cycle was similar to a representative fast spectrum system.

	abstract = {Thorium-based nuclear fuel cycles have received renewed attention in both research and public circles since about the year 2000. Much of the attention has been focused on nuclear fission energy production that utilizes thorium as a fertile element for producing fissionable 233U for recycle in thermal reactors, fast reactors, or externally driven systems. Lesser attention has been paid to other fuel cycle operations that are necessary for implementation of a sustainable thorium-based fuel cycle such as reprocessing and fabrication of recycle fuels containing 233U.This paper first identifies recent literature that has resulted from the renewed interest in thorium-based fuel cycles. Next, differences in the radiation characteristics of nuclear materials associated with thorium-based and uranium-based fuels are discussed, and the generic implications of the differences to nuclear material processing are identified. Then, experience at Oak Ridge National Laboratory concerning processing of thorium and 233U is described in terms of the processing projects and campaigns undertaken and the facilities in which the processing was implemented. This experience then provides the basis for a generalized discussion of processing nuclear materials associated with thorium-based fuel cycles as compared to uranium-based fuel cycles.This comparative discussion focuses on key out-of-reactor fuel cycle operations: reprocessing of metal-clad oxide and graphite-matrix oxide used nuclear fuels ({UNFs}) including head-end processing (shearing and dissolution), solvent extraction, product conversion, fuel fabrication, and waste management. It is concluded that the recycle of thorium-based {UNF} constituents (233U and thorium) is more technically challenging than the recycle of uranium-based {UNF} constituents (plutonium and uranium) based on the radiation, chemical, and physical characteristics of nuclear materials in thorium-based fuel cycles as compared to uranium-based fuel cycles.},

Thorium is frequently found within rare earth element–bearing minerals that exist in diverse types of mineral deposits, often in conjunction with other minerals mined for their commercial value. It may be possible to recover substantial quantities of thorium as a by-product from active titanium, uranium, tin, iron, and rare earth mines. Incremental physical and chemical processing is required to obtain a purified thorium product from thorium minerals, but documented experience with these processes is extensive, and incorporating thorium recovery should not be overly challenging. The anticipated environmental impacts of by-product thorium recovery are small relative to those of uranium recovery since existing mining infrastructure utilization avoids the opening and operation of new mines and thorium recovery removes radionuclides from the mining tailings.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) represent a class of reactors that use liquid salt, usually fluoride based or chloride based, as either a coolant with a solid fuel (such as fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactors) or as a combined coolant and fuel with the fuel dissolved in a carrier salt. For liquid-fueled {MSRs}, the salt can be processed online or in a batch mode to allow for removal of fission products as well as for introduction of fissile fuel and fertile materials during reactor operation. The {MSR} is most commonly associated with the 233U/thorium fuel cycle, as the nuclear properties of 233U combined with the online removal of parasitic absorbers enable the design of a thermal-spectrum breeder reactor. However, {MSR} concepts have been developed using all neutron energy spectra (thermal, intermediate, fast, and mixed-spectrum zoned concepts) and with a variety of fuels including uranium, thorium, plutonium, and minor actinides. Early {MSR} work was supported by a significant research and development (R\&D) program that resulted in two experimental systems operating at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s and 1960s: the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fueled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants: (1) a molten salt breeder reactor ({MSBR}) with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation and (2) a denatured molten salt reactor ({DMSR}) with enhanced proliferation resistance. {MSRs} have been selected as one of the Generation {IV} systems, and development activity has been seen in fast-spectrum {MSRs}, waste-burning {MSRs}, and {MSRs} fueled with low-enriched uranium as well as in more traditional thorium fuel cycle–based {MSRs}. This paper provides a historical background of {MSR} R\&D efforts, surveys and summarizes many of the recent developments, and provides analysis comparing thorium-based {MSRs} by way of example.},

	abstract = {In order to construct a sustainable society, it is necessary to consider fairness beyond generations and between countries. It is expected that Asian countries continue growing their economy and will result consuming more energy. More {CO}2 emission is not acceptable. Nuclear power has many advantages for reducing {CO}2 emission. However, it still has concerns of nuclear proliferation, radioactive waste and safety. It is necessary to overcome these concerns if nuclear power is expanded to Asian countries. Thorium utilization as nuclear fuel will be an opening key of these difficulties because thorium produces less plutonium, less radioactive waste. Safety will also be enhanced. The use of molten-salt reactor ({MSR}) triggered by plutonium supply from ordinary light water reactor ({LWR}) with uranium fuel will allow implementation of thorium fuel cycle with electricity capacity of about 446 {GWe} around at 2050. The other important sector in a view of sustainability is transportation. Transportation is essential for economy growth. Therefore it is inevitable to reduce {CO}2 emission from transportation sector. Electric vehicle ({EV}) will be used as a major mobility instead of gasoline engine cars. Rare-earth materials such as neodymium and dysprosium are necessary for producing {EV}. These materials are expected to be mined from Asian countries. It is often obtained with thorium as by-product. Thorium has not been used as nuclear fuel because it is not good for nuclear weapon and it does not have fissionable isotopes. Recent global trend of nuclear disarmament and accumulation of plutonium from uranium fuel cycle can support starting the use of thorium. Thorium utilization will help both to provide clean energy and to produce rare-earth for clean vehicle. These will create new industries in developing Asian countries. An international collaborative framework can be established by supplying resource from developing countries and supplying technology from developed countries. “{THE} Bank ({THorium} Energy Bank)” is proposed here as one part of such a framework.},

	abstract = {The most important target of the concept “sustainability” is to achieve fairness between generations. Its expanding interpolation leads to achieve fairness within a generation. Thus, it is necessary to discuss the role of nuclear power from the viewpoint of this definition. The history of nuclear power has been the control of the nuclear fission reaction. Once this is obtained, then the economy of the system is required. On the other hand, it is also necessary to consider the internalization of the external diseconomy to avoid damage to human society caused by the economic activity itself, due to its limited capacity. An extreme example is waste. Thus, reducing radioactive waste resulting from nuclear power is essential. Nuclear non-proliferation must be guaranteed. Moreover, the {FUKUSHIMA} accident revealed that it is still not enough that human beings control nuclear reaction. Further, the most essential issue for sustaining use of one technology is human resources in manufacturing, operation, policy-making and education. Nuclear power will be able to satisfy the requirements of sustainability only when these subjects are addressed. The author will review recent activities of a thorium molten-salt reactor ({MSR}) as a cornerstone for a sustainable society and describe its objectives and forecasts.},

	abstract = {Several options for designing fast reactors to operate in the Breed-and-Burn (B\&B) mode are compared and a strategy is outlined for early introduction of B\&B reactors followed by a gradual increase in the fuel utilization of such reactors. In the first phase the fast reactor core will consist of a subcritical B\&B blanket driven by a relatively small critical seed. As the required discharge burnup/radiation-damage to both driver and blanket fuel had already been proven, and as the depleted uranium fueled B\&B blanket could generate close to 2/3 of the core power and will have very low fuel cycle cost, the deployment of such fast reactors could start in the near future. The second phase consists of deploying self-sustaining stationary wave B\&B reactors. It will require development of fuel technology that could withstand peak burnups of {\textasciitilde}30\% and peak radiation damage to the cladding of {\textasciitilde}550 dpa. The third phase requires development of a fuel reconditioning technology that will enable using the fuel up to an average burnup of {\textasciitilde}50\%—the upper bound permitted by neutron balance considerations when most of the fission products are not separated from the fuel. The increase in the uranium ore utilization relative to that provided by contemporary power reactors is estimated to be 20, 40 and 100 folds for, respectively, phase 1, 2 and 3. The energy value of the depleted uranium stockpiles (“waste”) accumulated in the {US} is equivalent to, when used in the B\&B reactors, up to 20 centuries of the total 2010 {USA} supply of electricity. Therefore, a successful development of B\&B reactors could provide a great measure of energy sustainability and cost stability.},
