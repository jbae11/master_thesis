\section{Cyclus}

\Cyclus is an agent-based fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}, meaning
that each reactor, reprocessing plant, and fuel fabrication plant is modeled as an agent.
A \Cyclus simulation contains prototypes, which are fuel cycle facility models (archetypes) with
pre-defined parameters, that are deployed in the simulation as \texttt{facility} agents.
Encapsulating the \texttt{facility} agents are the \texttt{Institution} and \texttt{Region}.
A \texttt{Region} agent holds a set of \texttt{Institution}s. 
An \texttt{Institution} agent can deploy or decommission \texttt{facility} agents.
The \texttt{Institution} agent is part of a \texttt{Region} agent,
which can contain multiple \texttt{Institution} agents. Several versions of \texttt{Institution}
and \texttt{Region} exist, varying in complexity and functions \cite{huff_extensions_2014}.
\texttt{DeployInst} is used as the institution archetype for this work, where the institution
deploys agents at user-defined timesteps. 

At each timestep,
agents make requests for materials or bid to supply them and exchange
with one another. A market-like mechanism called the dynamic resource exchange
\cite{gidden_agent-based_2015} governs the exchanges.
For output analysis, each material resource has a quantity, composition, name, and a unique identifier.

In this work, each nation is represented as a distinct \texttt{Region} agent,
that contains \texttt{Institution} agents, each deploying  \texttt{Facility} 
agents. The \texttt{Institution} agents then deploy agents according to 
a user-defined deployment scheme.

The Cyclus \gls{NFCS} framework and its
modeling ecosystem, the suite of agents and other
physics plug-in libraries compatible with it, incorporate
modern insights from simulation science and software
architecture \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. Cyclus
has a multitude of benefits from other available
\glspl{NFCS} codes - open-sourceness, modularity,
and extensibility. Its agent-based modeling approach
is ideal for modeling coupled, physics dependent
supply chain problems common in \glspl{NFC}.
The framework allows for dynamic loading of 
external libraries, which allows the users to plug-and-play
different types of physics models for \gls{NFC}
simulation.

\subsection{Open Source}
License agreements and institutional
approval is need for most \glspl{NFCS} like COSI, DANESS, DESAE, EVOLCODE,
FAMILY21, NFCSim, ORION and VISION \cite{juchau_modeling_2017}, making
it hard for both the usage and development in an academic settings.
On the other hand, Cyclus relies completely on open source,
free libraries, allowing all users to both use and develop the
Cylcus framework and existing libraries. The open-sourceness
of Cyclus encourages collaboration - any user can propose
improvements or provide input for Cyclus.

\subsection{Modularity and Extensibility}
In most modern \glspl{NFCS}, the facilities and their
behavior (and its fidelity) is confined in the software.
Also, most modern \glspl{NFCS} are restricted to model
a set of fuel cycles (once-through, continuous reprocessing)
with restrictions to connections between facilities. On the
other hand, Cyclus allows users to plug-and-play different libraries
that contain different fidelity modules within the Cyclus framework
(shown in figure \ref{fig:core}).
Also, the Cyclus simulation relies on a market-based model
for material trades between facilities, so the user can design
any novel fuel cycle. Also, this gives Cyclus the option to not
be limited to nuclear fuel cycles, but any system analysis
involving multiple connected facilities with physics-based
calculations.

The connection between the framework and the agents is
the dynamic resource exchange (DRE), where the agents
interact with each other through material offers and requests.
The kernel solves the material offers and requests, and executes
the transaction between two agents.

\subsection{Cyclus' fitness for real-world \gls{NFC} transition scenario}
The Cyclus framework and its extension libraries fulfill all the functionalities
specified by Brown et al. \cite{brown_identification_2016}.  Additionally,
its text-based input structure and discrete facility modeling capabilities
allow modeling of real-world, individual reactors. Finally, 
the addition of a \gls{MSR} model can be achieved without altering
Cyclus due to its modularity. The details of the implementation
of these capabilities are shown in the next chapter.
