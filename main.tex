\title{Nuclear Fuel Cycle Transition Scenarios based upon current inventory}
\author{Jin Whan Bae}


%% Create an abstract that can also be used for the ProQuest abstract.
%% Note that ProQuest truncates their abstracts at 350 words.
\begin{abstract}
This work analyses the historic operation of nuclear energy and the \gls{UNF} inventory.
With the calculated inventory, we suggest different
directions of fuel cycle transition scenarios that will maximize the currently
available resource. Several case studies of this includes the European region,
and the United States.

\section{Background}
Nuclear energy is the largest provider of carbon-free energy
in the United States. However, several problems remain with nuclear
energy, with one of the biggest one being the problem of nuclear waste.
From the 1950s, the United States have been trying to commission a 
geological waste disposal site for its `spent' fuel. However, even
after 60 years, this endeavor has yet to accomplish of substantial value.

On the other hand, the recent advances in nuclear technology produced
a multitude of new reactor designs. The new reactors designs also 
experiment with new forms of fuel that deviate from an enriched uranium
oxide fuel. (why? fast spectrum and molten salt) These advances in new
technology has fueled the dream of a `closed' fuel cycle, where little to no
supply of natural material is required, that `used' fuel from one reactor,
after processing, could fuel another reactor.

This rather noble thought is not without challenges, such as the 
cost of new reprocessing and fuel fabrication sites, as well as
security implications of processing \gls{UNF} rather than disposing them.

Thus, this analysis serves to provide a metric where the benefits and
the costs are weighed upon each other. A benefit of `closing' the fuel cycle
is a lowered repository requirement, both in volume and rigor (timescale).
The cost of transition is the fuel processing facilities and new reactor
deployment.



\section{Introduction}
This paper analyzes a real scenario, where the fuel cycle
simulation of the historical nuclear operation of a region is run,
while tracking the inventory. This simulation will provide insight into
the available resources (e.g. plutonium) and the required repository
capacity if the region maintains the status quo.

After the historical operation to the current date, two different 
scenarios are run, one with transition into a `closed' fuel cycle
and another the status quo. Various metrics of the nuclear fuel cycle,
like accumulated \gls{UNF} mass, decay heat, natural resources used, etc.
