%% Create an abstract that can also be used for the ProQuest abstract.
%% Note that ProQuest truncates their abstracts at 350 words.
\begin{abstract}
This work measures different sustainability metrics of various
thorium fuel cycles, through a SERPENT, a high-fidelity reactor analysis
code, coupled with CYCLUS, an agent-based fuel cycle simulator.
