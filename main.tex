\begin{abstract}
Recent interest in advanced reactors and the following need for techno-economic
transitions has increased the demand for tools necessary
to model complex \glspl{NFC} and advanced reactor technologies.
This thesis demonstrates the capability of Cyclus, the
agent-based fuel cycle simulator, to model, simulate, and analyze
real-life fuel cycle transition scenarios. I introduce new methods
and tools that use various databases to model and simulate real-world
nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios involving advanced reactor
technologies.

The development of the capability takes
three steps: (1) benchmarking
Cyclus to other \glspl{NFCS};
(2) developing new methods and tools necessary for modeling and simulating
real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios; (3)
simulation of both domestic and international nuclear technology
transitions.

The methods and tools developed for such capabilities include:
(1) modeling and simulating past and current
nuclear fleet using historic nuclear reactor operations
database; (2) modeling individual reactors and its operating history
to calculate nuclear material inventory; (3) modeling \gls{MSR} behavior
in a large-scale fuel cycle simulation.

Benchmark results show that Cyclus results coincide
with results from other \gls{NFCS} with minor differences
due to modeling reactor behavior.
Additionally, this thesis demonstrates the Cyclus capability to effectively
model and simulate real-life \gls{NFC} transition scenarios
that involve advanced reactor technologies such as \glspl{MSR}.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I consider all my output as a result of me standing on the shoulder
of giants. There have been multiple giants that were kind enough
to lend me their shoulders. Notably, the tallest of all, my advisor
and mentor Kathryn Huff, who patiently guided me from my academic
infancy. Also, I owe the world to my parents and loving brother who
brought me up with love
from my actual infancy.  I also thank the staff of Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Joushua L. Peterson-Droogh, Eva Davidson, Ben Betzler and Andrew Worrall for their
guidance over the summer.

I also cannot express enough gratitude to my friends and colleagues. My greatest
assets and partners that I have had the privilege to cohabitate with, Daniel
O'Grady and Steven Stemmley, who were the logical anchor in my life. Also, my colleagues
Andrei Rykhlevskii, Gwendolyn Chee, Gregory Westphal, Gyu Tae Park, Sun Myung Park, and
Anshuman Chuabe have been of great help. Last but not least I thank my long-time friends Jieon Kim,
Eric Bae, Daniel Stewart, Corey Burden, Shane Riew, Steve Chung, my comrades from the 12DIV Engineering 3CO,
Christine Song, Gyum Hurr and Jae Man Jung.
