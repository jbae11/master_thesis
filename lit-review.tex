\subsection{Benchmark Study of Computer Codes for System Analysis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
\cite{benchmar_laurent_2009}

Important fuel cycle simulation parameters:
Discrete batches (only COSI6) allows more complex comparison of results
Decay of nuclides
depletion calculation


\subsection{The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
\cite{MITEI}

Better focus on LWR technology, since the uranium resources
won't be a problem for another century or so.

Comments on obvious things like we need a long term unf repository
where a consent-based, local community cooperative strategy is employed.

\textbf{"Closed fuel cycle design has focused on what goes back to the reactor but not on how wastes 
are managed. "}

US classifies waste depending on source, not hazard.

Fuel leasing from big countries to small countries
to provide an incentive to not pursue nuclear weapons program

R\&D Priorities:
better LWR technolgoy
waste disposal options
modeling trade off among options
other nuclear reactor applications (process heat)
