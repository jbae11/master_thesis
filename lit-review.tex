\subsection{Benchmark Study of Computer Codes for System Analysis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
\cite{benchmark_laurent_2009}

Important fuel cycle simulation parameters:
Discrete batches (only COSI6) allows more complex comparison of results
Decay of nuclides
depletion calculation


\subsection{The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
\cite{MITEI}

Better focus on LWR technology, since the uranium resources
won't be a problem for another century or so.

Comments on obvious things like we need a long term unf repository
where a consent-based, local community cooperative strategy is employed.

\textbf{"Closed fuel cycle design has focused on what goes back to the reactor but not on how wastes are managed. "}

US classifies waste depending on source, not hazard.

Fuel leasing from big countries to small countries
to provide an incentive to not pursue nuclear weapons program

R\&D Priorities:
better LWR technolgoy
waste disposal options
modeling trade off among options
other nuclear reactor applications (process heat)

\subsection{Benefits and concerns of a closed fuel cycle}
\cite{widder_benefits_2010}


\subsection{Advanced Fuel Cycle Economic Analysis of Symbiotic Light-Water Reactor and Fast Burner Reactor Systems}
\cite{shropshire_advanced_2009}

Large cost uncertainties associated with all fuel cycle strategies.

Reveals that a closed fuel cycle are about 10\% more expensive in terms of 
electricity generation cost.


\subsection{Nuclear Fuel Cycle Transition Scenario Studies}
\cite{oecd_nuclear_2009}

Key issues:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Time lines: Implementation and development of required technologies
    \item Materials inventory: Storage capacities
    \item Materials management: appropriate inventory needs to exist
    \item Material dynamics impact: Dynamics effects
    \item Economic: Cost should be low
\end{enumerate}


Metrics (National Energy policy objectives and associated technology requirements):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enhance proliferation resistance
    \item Waste management and disposal
    \item Reduce HLW repository
    \item Minimize environmental impact
    \item Security of energy supply
\end{enumerate}


Externalities:
Internalisation of external costs -> security of supply / carbon emissions
\textbf{Value of actinide burning -> no more long-term stewardship of waste}


\subsection{Proliferation Resistance Assessment Methodology for Nuclear Fuel Cycles}
\cite{charlton_proliferation_2007}

Proliferation resistance is a measure of the relative increase in barriers 
(intrinsic to material and extrinsic) to impede the proliferation of nuclear weapons
either by diversion of material by a state in possession of a system of theft
of material by a terrorist sub-national group.

Commonly agreed upon attributes for proliferation resistance:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extraordinary reduction of special nuclear material (Pu, HEU)
    \item Avoidance of separated SNM streams
    \item Designing material / process so that it can be more readily safeguarded (material accountancy and containment / surveillance)
\end{enumerate}

Focus should be on material moving through the fuel cycle

Tracks a unit mass of material through its fuel cycle and assesses the proliferation resistance

total nuclear security metric

\textbf{Extremely reproducible metric evaluation}


\subsection{The Economics of Reprocessing Versus Direct Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel}
\cite{bunn_economcis_2004}


\subsection{Thoughts}

It seems like the decision to invest and implement advanced fuel cycles and 
reactors depend heavily on the future prospect of nuclear energy demand.

If a market develops for other side products (like hydrogen, desalinization),
there might be a bigger economic incentive to develop advanced reactors and 
fuel cycles.
