Since the scope of this study is broad and interdisciplinary,
I read through numerous literature to gain insight into the
general consensus of advanced fuel cycles and completed studies.


\section{Metrics and Parameters}

An evaluation of a complex system like the nuclear fuel cycle
requires clear, quantitative metrics.
There have been many honest efforts by expert groups
to identify and quantify the key metrics of fuel cycles,
 such as the Evaluation and Screening Study
\cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}. However, the metrics from the E\&S study
are not quite appropriate for transition scenarios, for the evaluation and simulation
were done in static fuel cycles. This work intends to find important
metrics in a transition scenario.
For reference, the metrics
identified in the Evaluation and Screening study is listed in
table \ref{tab:es}.

    \begin{tabular}{cc}
        \hline
        \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Parameter} \\ \hline
        \multirow{5}{*}{\shortstack{Nuclear Waste Management \\ (per energy)}} & Mass of \gls{UNF} + \gls{HLW} \\
         & Activity of \gls{UNF} + \gls{HLW} at 100 years \\
         & Activity of \gls{UNF} + \gls{HLW} at 100,000 years \\
         & Mass of \gls{DU} + \gls{RU}\\
         & Volume of \gls{LLW} \\ \hline
        \multirow{2}{*}{\shortstack{Proliferation Risk / \\ Material Security}} & Material Attractiveness \\
         & Targets for Malevolent Use \\ \hline
        \multirow{4}{*}{\shortstack{Environmental Impact \\(per energy)}} & Land use \\

        \multirow{1}{*}{\shortstack{Resource Utilization\\ (per energy)}} & Natural U required \\ \hline

        \multirow{4}{*}{Others} & Safety \\

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

While metrics are the outputs of a fuel cycle transition, the parameters
are inputs to a fuel cycle transition scenario, and are subject to
variability. The varying parameters impacts the metrics, which causes
the uncertainty in the outcome of a fuel cycle.
Key parameters in fuel cycle transitions have been identified
by the OECD-NEA study on uncertainty \cite{hyland_effects_2015}. In this
study, some of these parameters (organized in table \ref{tab:sens})
are swept over a range to quantify its effect on the metrics.
As mentioned in the introduction, the correlations are with static
metrics, not what parameters are important for incentivizing transition.

        \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Parameter} \\ \hline
        \multirow{4}{*}{Fissile Inventory and Consumption} & Fissile Burnup \\
         & Fresh fuel composition \\
         & Cycle length \\
         & Breeding Grain\\ \hline
        \multirow{4}{*}{Waste} & Initial \gls{MA} content in fuel \\
         & Recuperation Rate (MA) \\

         & Enrichment Tail \\ \hline
        \multirow{4}{*}{Fabrication and Reprocessing} & Minimum cooling time \\
        & Fabrication Time\\

        \multirow{4}{*}{General} & Reactor Lifetime\\

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Publications from MIT, while taking a more
reluctant stance on the need to transition into a `closed' fuel cycle,
provides broader metrics like economics,
safety, waste management, or energy independence.
 The report's criteria to compare fuel cycles
is replicated in table \ref{tab:mit}.

\begin{table}[h]

        \textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Technical} & \textbf{Institutional}\\ \hline
        Economics & Overnight Capital Costs & Financing, Regulation \\
        Safety & Risk Assessment & Regulatory structure \\
        Waste Management & Waste form, time of storage & Regulation, Societal view \\
        Environment & Water / land consumption & Greenhouse gas regulation \\
        Resource utilization & Uranium costs & Security of supply \\
        Nonproliferation & Separated plutonium & Institutional arrangements for fuel \\

\section{Economics}
Currently, most fuel cycles in the world are once-through,
with the exception of France's \gls{MOX} reprocessing for its
\glspl{LWR}. Because there has not been a commercial advanced
fuel cycle, with large-scale reprocessing and fast reactor
operation,there are large cost uncertainties are associated
with fuel cycle strategies \cite{d._e._shropshire_advanced_2009}.

Also, with the now abundant uranium resources and a possibility
of uranium seawater extraction, prospective uranium fuel costs are relatively
low. This led to a general consensus that `closed' cycles are
more expensive than once-through-cycles
\cite{d._e._shropshire_advanced_2009, bunn_economics_2004, charpin_economic_2000}.

With a high risk and uncertainty associated with advanced fuel cycles,
and the fact that taking the risk to transition may cost more,
economics does not seem to be a dominant incentive for transitioning
into an advanced fuel cycle.
