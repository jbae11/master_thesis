I developed two extensions to leverage 
the capabilities of \Cyclus to model
real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios.
The first extension is a python input-generating module
that automates scenario generation of the real-world 
nuclear fleet at any point in time. The second extension
is a \Cyclus archetype that mimics \gls{MSR} feed and removal
behavior using an HDF5 database generated from SaltProc.

\section{\texttt{cyclus-input-gen}}
\label{sec:writeinput}
The python package \texttt{cyclus-input-gen} contains
multiple submodules for automating \Cyclus input generation.
The submodule \texttt{from\_pris} automates the generation of \Cyclus input files
to model the state of reactor fleets at a given
point in time.

The script reads from the \glsfirst{PRIS} database \cite{iaea_nuclear_2018}
and extracts data about each reactor's country, reactor unit,
type, net capacity (MWe), status, operator, construction date,
first criticality date, first grid date, commercial date,
and shutdown date (if applicable). The user inputs simulation
configurations such as start year, start month, and
simulation duration. \texttt{from\_pris} uses the collected data to
fill out a template into a \Cyclus input file. 
Diagram \ref{diag:log_flow} shows the logical flow of the module.

\subsection{Reactor deployment calculation}
The module calculates the deployment
scheme of reactors and their lifetimes by assuming
that all reactors shut down after 60 years of operation.
If the expected shutdown date is later than the user-input
simulation start date,
the reactor is not written in the input. If the reactor was
operational prior to the simulation start date,
and its shutdown date later than simulation start date,
the reactor is deployed at the beginning of simulation with its remaining lifetime.
If the reactor's start date is later than the simulation
start date, and the shutdown time is undefined, the reactor
is deployed at the defined start date with 60 years of lifetime.

\subsection{Reactor parameter calculation}

The module calculates the core sizes of various reactor
types by using a linear core size model. It assumes that
the number of assemblies in a 
reactor core scales linearly from a model reactor design,
as shown in the equation below. The mass per assembly
is kept constant.
The model reactor designs are listed in table \ref{tab:lin_core}.

\[
A = A_{ref} \cdot \frac{\text{P}}{P_{ref}}
\]
\[
N_{assem.pwr} = 157 \cdot \frac{\text{P}}{1,100}
\]
\[
N_{assem.bwr} = 764 \cdot \frac{\text{P}}{10,098}
\]
\[
N_{assem.phwr} = 4,560 \cdot \frac{\text{P}}{700}
\]
\[
A = \text{number of assemblies in approximated core}
\]
\[
P = \text{power capacity of reactor}
\]

\section{saltproc\_reactor}
The SaltProc reactor is a \Cyclus facility archetype designed to 
model \gls{MSR} behavior using a database. It roughly couples ``SaltProc'' \cite{rykhlevskii_online_2017}
and \Cyclus, by using the output from SaltProc to mimic \gls{MSR}
feed and removal behavior in \Cyclus.

This method is similar to the simplified implementation of
recipe reactors, in which the depletion calculation is performed outside of the
fuel cycle simulation. Instead of a single depletion calculation
used in a recipe reactor, this reactor uses a database of recipes
to capture the continuously varying state of liquid-fueled reactors like \glspl{MSR}.

\subsection{Code description}
The user provides only of the commodity names
for each stream (e.g. waste, fertile), and the database path, since the
HDF5 database already contains the notion of reactor design,
reprocessing scheme, and other reactor parameters (shown in
figure \ref{diag:hdf5_flow}). The commodity names are needed
for reactor agents to communicate with other \Cyclus agents
in exchanging material.

At every timestep, 
The \texttt{SaltProc Reactor} calculates the material mass
and composition accumulated during the \Cyclus timestep,
as shown in equation below.

\[
M_{T} = \sum m_T
\]
\[
m_{T} = \sum_{t=(T-1)}^{T} m_{t}
\]
\[
M_T = \text{total mass of stream in one \Cyclus timestep}
\]
\[
m_T = \text{mass of isotope in one \Cyclus timestep}
\]
\[
m_t = \text{mass of isotope in one SaltProc timestep}
\]


\section{Limitations of the database approach}
\label{sec:limit}
The limitations of this database approach are that it does not
take into account the changing incoming fuel compositions due to decay.
The separated \gls{TRU} composition may vary depending on the duration
an \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} assembly has been cooled, thus affecting the performance
of the \gls{MSR}. The database approach assumes a fixed input salt
composition, which is not the case in this simulation, because reprocessed
\gls{TRU} has varying decay times from discharge when it is fabricated and
put in the \gls{MSR}.

This limitation is similar to that of recipe reactors, in which the
fuel is transmuted to a pre-generated recipe regardless of the
incoming fuel composition. For example, a recipe reactor
depleting a \gls{MOX} fuel would deplete the \gls{MOX} fuel
to the same composition regardless of its fresh fuel composition.
